# Awesome Window Manager

## Themeing

> See: [Change Awesome appearance](https://awesomewm.org/doc/api/documentation/06-appearance.md.html)

Awesome has a lot of variables to allow you to customize the look of default awesome, see the above link for a list.
Below I have listed what format the different variable types support.

### Colors

> See: [gears.color](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/blob/master/lib/gears/color.lua)

This is anything supported by `gears.color`:

* HTML colors
* Images
* patterns
* radial ...
* TODO

### Shape

TODO = function

### Image

TODO - actual image or *SURFACE*
