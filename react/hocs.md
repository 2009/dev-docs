# Higher Order Components (HOCs)

HOCs allow you to perform Component composition. A HOC will wrap a component
and add additional functionality.

Some uses of HOCs include:

- Toggles (eg. feature flags, desktop/mobile)
- Connecting data stores or services (see `connect` for `react-redux`)
- Tracking analytics
- For cross cutting concerns
- Presentational containers (page w/ title)
