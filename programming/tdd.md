# Test Driven Development (TDD)

> Avoid testing implementation details, test behaviors. [link][2]

[DevTernity 2017: Ian Cooper - TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong][1]  

* Test behaviors, not implementation
* Test your public api, not internals
* Red-Green-Refactor
  Green = develop a solution as fast as possible, commiting any sins
  nessesary
* Isolate tests from other tests, not classes/implementation
